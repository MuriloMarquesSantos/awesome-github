## Step By Step to boost our Github profiles

- [ ] Main profile
  - [ ] Set the profile Bio with a photo and a brief description of professional experience/personality/beliefs
  - [ ] Create a repository with the same name of your Github Username to create a Profile README.md. Use this [repository](https://github.com/MuriloMarquesSantos/MuriloMarquesSantos) as example.
  - [ ] Organize your Pinned repositories. Make sure the most relevant ones come first.
  - [ ] Check your contributions. Ideally, you should commit code regularly. There are times in which you will not code as often as you'd want to and that's ok!
  - [ ] Search for your favorite project and STAR it.
  - [ ] Search for a developer you admire and follow him/her.

- [ ] Inside each project
  - [ ] Make sure it has a clear description and tags;
  - [ ] Explain the purpose of the project;
  - [ ] Detail folder organization and architecture used;
  - [ ] Detail technologies used;
  - [ ] Make sure you explain how to setup and test;
  - [ ] Include link for documentations, API References and any other useful link;
  - [ ] Talk about the evolution of the software;
  - [ ] Explain how people can contribute, if you are open to that.
